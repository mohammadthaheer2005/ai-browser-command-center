## 📽️ Project Vision
**AI Browser Command Center** is not just another browser script. It is an autonomous "digital employee" designed to handle the complexity of the modern web. Built with a focus on **security**, **task chaining**, and **multi-modal interaction**, it bridges the gap between high-level intent and low-level browser execution.

Whether it's monitoring WhatsApp responses in real-time, performing competitive market research, or acting as an interactive coding tutor, the AI Command Center executes with human-like precision.

## ⚡ Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Task Chaining & Persistent Memory
While competitive agents treat every command as an isolated event, this system maintains a **stateful memory buffer**. 
*   *Workflow Example:* "Find the cheapest RTX 4090 on Amazon" ➡️ "Now send that link to my Business Manager on WhatsApp." 
*   The agent understands context and carries data across different web platforms seamlessly.

### 🛡️ Secure WhatsApp Orchestration
A robust auto-reply engine that monitors your WhatsApp Web in real-time.
*   **Natural Language Processing:** Replies in the user's native tongue (Hindi, Tamil, English, etc.).
*   **Guardrail Security:** Hard-coded security layers prevent the sharing of OTPs, passwords, or sensitive financial data.
*   **Live Web Integration:** If queried about something unknown, the agent performs a Google search and responds with cited sources—all without human intervention.

### 🎓 Expert Education Mode
A dedicated environment for students and developers.
*   **Tutoring Brain:** Provides deep-dive explanations, not just answers.
*   **Clean Code Delivery:** Generates production-ready, syntax-highlighted code blocks for multiple languages.
*   **Logical Solver:** Handles complex mathematics and logical reasoning using a tree-of-thought approach.

### 🎙️ Multi-Modal UI/UX
*   **Voice Command Center:** Full speech-to-intent integration for hands-free operation.
*   **Premium Dark Engine:** A custom-built Tkinter interface with high contrast and intuitive navigation.
*   **Ad-Blocking Integration:** Built-in heuristics to auto-skip YouTube ads and navigate around intrusive pop-ups.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
The system is built on a modular "Shell-and-Core" architecture for maximum security and scalability.

*   **Logic Engine:** Unified LLM interface (Gemini 1.5 Pro / GPT-4o) using `browser-use`.
*   **Orchestration:** Async background threads to prevent GUI locking.
*   **Persistence:** Localized browser profiling for one-time logins.
*   **Security Layer:** Encrypted integrity checks to prevent unauthorized standalone execution.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Windows 10/11
*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   A valid Google Gemini or OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammadthaheer2005/ai-browser-command-center.git
   cd ai-browser-command-center
   ```

2. **Setup Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Activation**
   > **Note:** Due to the proprietary nature of the core AI orchestration, this project requires a local security configuration file (`internal_sys_config.dat`) to activate the automation engine. For enterprise access or research collaboration, please contact the repository owner.

4. **Launch**
   ```bash
   python AgentApp.py
   ```
